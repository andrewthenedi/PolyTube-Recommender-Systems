# PolyTube Teleplay

PolyTube is an online media platform which provides online teleplay services. For teleplays
already in service, the platform will record user ratings and give an average rating for each
teleplay on the web page. For recently published teleplays without ratings, how to predict them
is essential for the investment policy of PolyTube. On the other hand, to attract users watching
more teleplays on the platform, providing accurate and personalized recommendation services is
also meaningful for revenue increase. This project will help PolyTube improve their system
with the knowledge of COMP4434 (Big Data Analytics).
